# PurityProject
A open source virtual assistant


(Warning: This code does not seek to rival professional projects, it's a small project to increase my python knowledge)

Hello! Welcome to my little project "Purity Assistant" Where I will try to capture some of the characteristics of the most famous assistants on the market (As Siri or Alexa)

Modules used (Install if any are missing):

* Calendar
* MSVCRT
* os
* gtts
* Datetime
* Selenium


(This is in Spanish, we will soon try to create a version in other languages)

(Note: For the search option to work correctly, you must add the path where the 'geckodriver.exe' file was installed in the PATH variable in the system environment variables option)
